        "**1) What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-**Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.OOP allows objects to interact with each other using four basic principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These four OOP principles enable objects to communicate and collaborate to create powerful applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, “+” can be used for addition as well as string concatenation. Static Polymorphism is based on Method Overloading, and Dynamic Polymorphism is based on Method Overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2)What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-**A class is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects.Classes are used to create and manage new objects, and to support inheritance, a key concept in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example ,A class could represent a person, with a private data member like a social security number, and a method like bankTransaction() that might access the social security number.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3) What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** An object is a unit of code that represents a data structure or abstract data type. Objects are the basic building blocks of OOP applications and are the things that are considered first when designing a program.Objects contain fields, or state variables, that hold data, and methods, or procedures, that define the object's behavior. Objects are instances of a class or subclass, which defines their structure.Objects can interact with each other through defined interfaces. Objects can sometimes correspond to real-world things, such as a person, a car, a shopping cart, or a customer. Objects can also represent more abstract entities, such as an open file or a measurement translator.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Abstraction and encapsulation are both used to simplify complex systems, but they differ in their focus and goals:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction:-**\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction focuses on what an object does, and hides unnecessary details to make it easier to understand. Abstraction can help programmers create reusable components that can be adapted to different situations.Abstraction is implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "for example, A car's steering wheel and pedals abstract the complex driving mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation:-**\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation focuses on how an object's data is accessed and manipulated, and hides the internal details of how an object works. Encapsulation can help ensure data integrity and privacy by preventing unauthorized access and modification.Encapsulation is implemented using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "for example, the car engine's internal components are encapsulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5) What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Dunder methods known as magic methods or special methods,its predefined methods that are used to give special functionality to classes and objects. The term \"dunder\" is short for \"double underscores\". Dunder methods are recognized by the double underscore format: __methodname__()\n",
        "Dunder methods are used to Perform arithmetic operations on numeric type attributes ,Initialize a new class instance, Overload certain methods to make their behaviors unique to that class, Create objects from a class\n",
        "Provide a string representation of an object , Make a class iterable, Compare objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "for example,\n",
        "\n",
        "**init():** Initializes the state of a new instance\n",
        "\n",
        "**add():** Defines an element-wise addition operation using the + operator\n",
        "\n",
        "**aiter():** Returns an asynchronous iterator\n",
        "\n",
        "**anext():** Returns an awaitable object\n",
        "\n",
        "**6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. This creates a hierarchy of classes that share attributes and methods.The class whose members are inherited. It's also known as the superclass or parent class.The class that inherits the members of the base class. It's also known as the subclass or child class. Inheritance allows you to reuse code by inheriting attributes and methods from an existing class. This reduces redundancy and makes code more efficient.Inheritance creates a hierarchical relationship between classes, which provides a structured approach to building and extending classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "for example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Parent class\n",
        "    class Animal:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name  \n",
        "\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        pass  \n",
        "\n",
        "    # Child class inheriting from Animal\n",
        "        class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return f\"{self.name} barks!\"  # Override the speak method\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Creating an instance of Dog\n",
        "      dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
        "        print(dog.speak())  \n",
        "        \n",
        "        \n",
        " Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " **7) What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        " **Ans:-** Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It's a feature that allows a programming language to present the same interface for different underlying data types.\n",
        "\n",
        " **increases code reusability:** Multiple classes can implement the same method in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Allows for abstraction and encapsulation:** Polymorphism is essential for achieving these concepts in programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Makes code cleaner and more intuitive:** A program can handle different tasks with the same method name.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:-1] Built-in function\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(len(\"Hello\"))  # String length\n",
        "    print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # List length\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(max(1, 3, 2))  # Maximum of integers\n",
        "    print(max(\"a\", \"z\", \"m\"))  # Maximum in strings\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  2]polymorphism in functions\n",
        "\n",
        "    def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "    print(add(3, 4))           # Integer addition\n",
        "    print(add(\"Hello, \", \"World!\"))  # String concatenation\n",
        "    print(add([1, 2], [3, 4])) # List concatenation\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers to limit access to a class's variables and methods. Python uses a convention-based approach, rather than keywords like \"public\", \"private\", and \"protected\":\n",
        "\n",
        "**Private members**\n",
        "Use a double underscore prefix (__) to indicate a private member. Private members are only accessible within the class and are intended for internal use.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Protected members**\n",
        "Use a single underscore prefix (_) to indicate a protected member. Protected members are intended to be used within the class and its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Public members**\n",
        "By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are public and can be accessed from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "for example,\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, account_number):\n",
        "      self.__account_number = account_number # Private attribute\n",
        "    def __validate_pin(self, pin): # Private method to validate the PIN\n",
        "       return len(str(pin)) == 4\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the __account_number attribute and the __validate_pin method are marked as private using double underscores\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**9)What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** A constructor is a special method that's automatically called when an object is created from a class.The main purpose of a constructor is to initialize the attributes of an object when it's created. The constructor method's name is always __init__ .The __init__ method is called with the newly created object as the first argument. The method can then use the self keyword to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Example,\n",
        "In the example below, the __init__ method is called when the Person object is created, and it sets the name and age attributes of the object:\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Person:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "          self.name = lisha\n",
        "          self.age = 22\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  **10)What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Ans:-** class methods and static methods are different types of methods that are attached to a class, but have different characteristics and uses:-\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Class methods**\n",
        "These methods are attached to the class itself, not the class's object. They can access and modify the class state, and are often used for actions related to the class. Class methods can also be used as alternative constructors. The first parameter of a class method is cls. To create a class method, use the\n",
        " classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "    from datetime import date\n",
        "    class Person:\n",
        "     def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "    self.name = name\n",
        "    self.age = age\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "     def fromBirthYear(cls, name, birthYear):\n",
        "    return cls(name, date.today().year - birthYear)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Static methods**\n",
        "These methods are also attached to the class, but they cannot access or modify the class state. Static methods are used for utility functions that don't require access to the class or instance. To create a static method, use the\n",
        " staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "    class myClass:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "    self.x = x\n",
        "     @staticmethod\n",
        "    def staticMethod():\n",
        "    return \"i am a static method\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**11) What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Method overloading is a function that allows you to call the same method in different ways by passing different arguments. You can create a method with a variable number of parameters, and then call it with different numbers of arguments.\n",
        "For example, you can create a method that can be called with zero, one, or more arguments.\n",
        "Method overloading can make your code more flexible, intuitive, and cleaner. It can also improve the quality of your code and make it more reusable and accessible.\n",
        "\n",
        "for example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    def product(a, b):\n",
        "    p = a * b\n",

        "    p = a * b*c\n",
        "    print(p)\n",
        "    # product(4, 5)\n",
        "     # This line will call the second product method\n",
        "      product(4, 5, 5)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Output:- 100\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**12) What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Method overriding is a feature in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to replace a method in its superclass with its own implementation.\n",
        "The subclass method has the same name, parameters, and return type as the superclass method. The version of the method that is executed depends on the object used to invoke itMethod overriding allows developers to customize the behavior of inherited methods without changing the parent class's code. It also enables polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably.\n",
